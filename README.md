AFWebViewController
===================

In-app browser

## Description

In-app browser for quick implementation in your app. Pretty much inspired by [SVWebViewController](https://github.com/TransitApp/SVWebViewController). 
Uses [WKWebView](https://developer.apple.com/library/IOs/documentation/WebKit/Reference/WKWebView_Ref/index.html) for a much faster browing experience. 

**Requires iOS 8+**
